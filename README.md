# Electronics Sales Data Analysis Using Python  

This project involves analyzing the electronics sales data using Python to gain insights that can help increase sales and optimize advertisements more efficiently for the target audience.  

## Key Highlights  

### Data Cleaning and Processing  
- Cleaned and processed the data using **Pandas**, which includes:  
  - Data cleaning  
  - Data wrangling  
- Prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and performing transformations.  

### Data Analysis and Visualization  
- Analyzed the data using **Pandas**.  
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to answer key business questions such as:  
  - Which month had the largest sales?  
  - Which day had the largest sales?  
  - What time of the day were users most active?  
  - What were the top 10 most ordered combos?  
  - What was the most ordered product, and why?  

### Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating visualizations.  

## Findings and Outcomes  
- Identified sales trends across months, days, and specific times of the day.  
- Discovered the top 10 most ordered combos, helping to improve product bundling strategies.  
- Analyzed the most ordered product to understand customer preferences.  

## Impact  
The insights gained from this project can:  
- Help target advertisements during peak times.  
- Optimize inventory for high-demand products and popular combos, leading to better sales outcomes.
